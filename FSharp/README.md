# F#

My solutions for the Advent Of Code using F#

---

I am using this language for the **first** time, so, there will be mistakes and ugly code :sweat_smile:

But I am learning and I hope I will get better :blush:

Most of the boilerplate code taken from another [aoc repository](https://github.com/CameronAavik/AdventOfCode)
If you want to learn more about F# I encourage you to check out this repository :relieved:
